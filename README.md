TP Bandits - 3/12/2024

Hi everyone, a couple of announcements:
I confirm that I'll be giving the class in person on Monday 18th in Amphi Dieulafoy at Cochin (27 Fbg St Jacques)
The material for the graded assignment is here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/gkymnpqfjptp#8f0e2d
This exercise must be done in pairs
On Monday, we will dedicate the second half (roughly) of the class getting started with it. You will be able to ask me questions, about that or about other topics (PhDs, ELLIS applications, internships, etc.)
Please upload your assignments by December 3rd here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Fq6gJDu0_wY_6P-lkV5d1uUy4njjfR3?usp=sharing. Files should be named LASTNAME1_LASTNAME_2.
